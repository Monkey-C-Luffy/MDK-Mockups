# MDK-Mockups
### A set of community driven mockup classes to enable the simulation of Space Engineers ingame scripts in Visual Studio

Currently just getting set up, the intent of this repository is to gradually build up a set of mockup classes so you can test-run your MDK scripts in Visual Studio, thus having the full debugging capacity of that IDE on hand.


This repository is _very_ dependent on the community. If the community will not contribute, this repo will be too narrow to be helpful for many. This means that we need _your_ help to do it.


**Currently in experimental stage**

Please contact me on [Keen's discord](https://discord.gg/0hIE7GirODUqhfIg) if you want to help getting the basics of the repo up and running. As the repo grows there will be more tutorials and wikis. _We need you_.
